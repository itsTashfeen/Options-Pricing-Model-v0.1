## Key Components

### 1. Models (src/models/)
- **base_model.py**: Abstract base class defining the interface for option pricing models
- **black_scholes.py**: Implementation of the Black-Scholes option pricing model
- **binomial_tree.py**: Implementation of the Binomial Tree pricing model

### 2. Utilities (src/utils/)
- **volatility.py**: Contains various volatility calculation methods:
  - Historical volatility
  - EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average)
  - GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)
  - Parkinson volatility
  - Garman-Klass volatility

### 3. Main Application (src/app.py)
- Streamlit web interface
- Real-time data fetching
- Interactive option pricing
- Volatility analysis
- Greeks visualization

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. pip (Python package installer)
3. Git (for version control)
4. Basic understanding of:
   - Python syntax
   - Object-oriented programming
   - Financial mathematics basics

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Options-Pricing-Model-v0.1.git
cd Options-Pricing-Model-v0.1
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set Up API Keys**
Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:
```toml
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

5. **Run the Application**
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```
